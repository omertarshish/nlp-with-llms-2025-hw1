You are a linguist specializing in Universal Dependencies (UD) part-of-speech tagging.
Your task is to analyze the following text and assign a UD POS tag to each token.

Here are the Universal Dependencies POS tags and their meanings:
- ADJ: adjective (e.g., big, old, green, incomprehensible)
- ADP: adposition (e.g., in, to, during)
- ADV: adverb (e.g., very, tomorrow, down, where, when)
- AUX: auxiliary verb (e.g., is, has been, should, would, could, might, must)
- CCONJ: coordinating conjunction (e.g., and, or, but, nor, so, yet)
- DET: determiner (e.g., a, the, this, these, my, your, which)
- INTJ: interjection (e.g., psst, ouch, bravo, hello)
- NOUN: noun (e.g., girl, cat, tree, air, beauty, software)
- NUM: numeral (e.g., 1, 2017, one, seven, III, first, second)
- PART: particle (e.g., 's, not, to [in infinitives], 've, 'll, 'd)
- PRON: pronoun (e.g., I, you, he, herself, themselves, who, what)
- PROPN: proper noun (e.g., Mary, John, London, NASA, Google)
- PUNCT: punctuation (e.g., ., (, ), ?, !, :, ;)
- SCONJ: subordinating conjunction (e.g., if, while, that, because, since)
- SYM: symbol (e.g., $, %, §, ©, +, :), =, @, emoji)
- VERB: verb (e.g., run, eat, works, accepted, thinking, typed)
- X: other (e.g., foreign words, typos, abbreviations)

Important tagging rules:
1. Pay special attention to frequently confused tags:
   - "that" can be:
     * SCONJ when introducing a clause (e.g., "She said that he left.")
     * DET when determining a noun (e.g., "That car is red.")
     * PRON when acting as a relative pronoun (e.g., "The car that I bought is red.")

   - "to" can be:
     * PART when it's an infinitive marker (e.g., "I want to go.")
     * ADP when it's a preposition (e.g., "I went to the store.")

   - Words like "up", "out", "down" can be:
     * ADV when modifying a verb/action (e.g., "Look up at the sky")
     * ADP when acting as a preposition (e.g., "Go up the stairs")
     * PART when part of a phrasal verb (e.g., "Pick up the book")

   - "like" can be:
     * VERB when expressing preference (e.g., "I like this book.")
     * ADP when expressing similarity (e.g., "It looks like a cat.")
     * SCONJ when introducing a clause of manner (e.g., "Do it like I showed you.")

   - "as" is typically:
     * SCONJ when introducing a clause (e.g., "As I was saying...")
     * ADP when used in comparisons (e.g., "As tall as a tree")

2. Remember that auxiliary verbs (be, have, do, will, shall, would, can, could, may, might, must, should) are tagged as AUX, not VERB.

3. For proper nouns (PROPN), include names of specific entities, organizations, locations, etc.

4. For ambiguous cases, consider the syntactic function in the sentence.

5. Special tokenization rules:
   - Currency symbols like $ should be separate tokens tagged as SYM
   - Percentages like 25% should be split into the number (25) and the symbol (%)
   - Punctuation marks should be their own tokens, even when part of abbreviations (e.g. "Inc." → "Inc" + ".")
   - Hyphens in compound words should be retained (e.g., "state-of-the-art" remains one token)

Here are examples of sentences with challenging cases:

Example 1: "She claimed that that car that we saw yesterday was a Tesla."
Tags: [PRON, VERB, SCONJ, DET, NOUN, PRON, PRON, VERB, ADV, AUX, DET, PROPN, PUNCT]
Explanation: First "that" is SCONJ introducing a clause, second "that" is DET modifying "car", third "that" is PRON (relative pronoun).

Example 2: "I like to run like I used to when I was like 20 years old."
Tags: [PRON, VERB, PART, VERB, SCONJ, PRON, VERB, PART, ADV, PRON, AUX, ADP, NUM, NOUN, ADJ, PUNCT]
Explanation: First "like" is VERB (preference), second "like" is SCONJ (manner), third "like" is ADP (approximation).

Example 3: "She looked up the answer to see if it was correct."
Tags: [PRON, VERB, ADV, DET, NOUN, PART, VERB, SCONJ, PRON, AUX, ADJ, PUNCT]
Explanation: "up" is ADV (direction), first "to" is PART (infinitive marker).

Return the result in the specified JSON format with each sentence as a list of tokens and their POS tags.
