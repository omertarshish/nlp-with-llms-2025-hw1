# Pipeline vs. Joint Tagging Approaches for Segmentation and POS Tagging

This document explains the implementation and comparison of two different approaches for handling segmentation and POS tagging with LLMs.

## Approaches Implemented

### 1. Pipeline Approach

In the pipeline approach, segmentation and tagging are performed in separate sequential steps:

1. **Segmentation Step**:
   - Select relevant examples for segmentation
   - Prompt the LLM to segment the input text according to UD guidelines
   - Obtain a list of segmented tokens

2. **Tagging Step**:
   - Take the segmented tokens from the previous step
   - Prompt the LLM to assign POS tags to each token
   - Obtain the final tagged result

```
Original Text → [Segmentation Model] → Segmented Tokens → [Tagging Model] → Tagged Result
```

#### Advantages of Pipeline:
- Each step can be optimized independently
- Examples can be specifically tailored for each task
- Simpler prompts focused on a single task
- Errors can be isolated to a specific step

#### Disadvantages of Pipeline:
- Error propagation (segmentation errors affect tagging)
- No information sharing between tasks
- Multiple API calls, increasing latency and costs
- Cannot leverage mutual constraints between tasks

### 2. Joint Approach

In the joint approach, segmentation and tagging are performed simultaneously in a single step:

1. **Joint Step**:
   - Select relevant examples for segmentation and tagging
   - Prompt the LLM to both segment and tag the input text
   - Obtain the final tagged result directly

```
Original Text → [Joint Segmentation+Tagging Model] → Tagged Result
```

#### Advantages of Joint:
- No error propagation between steps
- Can leverage mutual constraints between tasks
- Single API call, reducing latency and costs
- Decision for one task can inform the other

#### Disadvantages of Joint:
- More complex prompt and task
- Cannot optimize each step independently
- May be harder for the model to handle both tasks at once
- Examples must cover both segmentation and tagging patterns

## Implementation Details

The comparison implementation (`compare_tagging_strategies.py`) includes:

1. **Pipeline Implementation**:
   - `segment_sentence()`: Segments text using example-based approach
   - `tag_segmented_sentence()`: Tags pre-segmented tokens
   - `pipeline_approach()`: Combines the two steps

2. **Joint Implementation**:
   - Uses the existing `tag_sentences_ud_with_examples()` function
   - Performs segmentation and tagging in a single step

3. **Evaluation System**:
   - Compares both approaches on a set of hard sentences
   - Calculates segmentation accuracy, tagging accuracy, and overall accuracy
   - Generates visualizations and a detailed analysis report

## Evaluation Metrics

The comparison evaluates three key metrics:

1. **Segmentation Accuracy**: 
   - Percentage of tokens correctly segmented
   - Calculated as: `correctly_segmented_tokens / total_gold_tokens`

2. **Tagging Accuracy**:
   - Percentage of correctly segmented tokens that are also correctly tagged
   - Calculated as: `correctly_tagged_tokens / correctly_segmented_tokens`

3. **Overall Accuracy**:
   - Percentage of tokens that are both correctly segmented and correctly tagged
   - Calculated as: `correctly_tagged_tokens / total_gold_tokens`

## Key Observations

When comparing pipeline vs. joint approaches, we observe:

1. **Error Propagation**:
   - In the pipeline, segmentation errors invariably lead to tagging errors
   - The joint approach can sometimes recover from potential segmentation errors

2. **Performance on Different Patterns**:
   - Contractions (`don't` → `do` + `n't`): Joint approach generally handles these better
   - Hyphenated compounds (`cost-benefit`): Pipeline may segment these more consistently
   - Special formats (URLs, emails): Results vary depending on examples provided

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Pipeline requires two API calls, increasing latency and costs
   - Joint approach is more efficient but may be more complex for the model

## Recommendations

Based on the implementation and evaluation:

1. **For General Use**:
   - The joint approach is generally more efficient and often more accurate
   - Error propagation in the pipeline can be a significant drawback

2. **For Specific Challenging Patterns**:
   - Consider a hybrid approach where particular patterns are handled by specialized methods
   - Example selection is crucial for both approaches

3. **For Further Improvement**:
   - Explore more sophisticated example selection strategies
   - Consider a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both methods
   - Implement a fallback mechanism for sentences where one approach fails

## Running the Comparison

To run the comparison:

```bash
python compare_tagging_strategies.py
```

This will:
1. Process a set of challenging sentences using both approaches
2. Calculate accuracy metrics for each approach
3. Generate visualizations comparing the approaches
4. Produce a detailed analysis report in `tagging_comparison_report.md`
